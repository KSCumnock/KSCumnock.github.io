# Fixes Applied - Email Notifications & Badge System

## 🔧 Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Email Notifications Not Working**
**Problem:** Emails weren't being sent when requests were submitted, approved, declined, or cancelled.

**Solution:** 
- Added proper email notification calls in all the right places
- Added UI feedback with toast notifications
- Shows "Sending email..." with a spinner
- Shows "Email sent!" with a checkmark (green)
- Shows "Email failed" with an X (red) if there's an error
- Toast notifications auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds

**Now works for:**
- ✅ New request submitted → Admins get notified
- ✅ Request approved → Employee gets notified
- ✅ Request declined → Employee gets notified
- ✅ Request cancelled → Employee gets notified

### 2. **Admin Panel Badge Not Showing**
**Problem:** The notification badge on the Admin Panel tab wasn't appearing when there were pending requests.

**Solution:**
- Added `updatePendingBadge()` function that counts pending requests
- Badge shows red circle with number of pending requests
- Badge pulses with animation to draw attention
- Badge updates automatically when:
  - App initializes
  - Request is submitted
  - Request is approved
  - Request is declined
  - Request is cancelled
  - Year is changed

## 🧪 Testing Checklist:

### Before EmailJS Setup (Should Show Warnings):
- [ ] Submit a request → See "Email not configured" toast
- [ ] Approve a request → See "Email not configured" toast
- [ ] Badge should appear with "1" when request is pending

### After EmailJS Setup:
- [ ] Submit a request → See "Sending email..." then "Email sent! Admins notified"
- [ ] Check admin inboxes → Should receive new request email
- [ ] Approve request → See "Sending email..." then "Email sent! [employee] notified"
- [ ] Badge should disappear when no pending requests
- [ ] Decline request → Employee receives declined email
- [ ] Cancel request → Employee receives cancelled email

## 💡 How It Works Now:

### Email Flow Example:

**1. Employee submits request:**
```
[Submit button clicked]
   ↓
[Toast: "Sending email... Notifying admins"]
   ↓
[EmailJS sends to all 7 admin emails]
   ↓
[Toast changes to: "Email sent! Admins notified"]
   ↓
[Badge appears on Admin Panel tab showing "1"]
```

**2. Admin approves request:**
```
[Approve button clicked]
   ↓
[Toast: "Sending email... Notifying John Smith"]
   ↓
[EmailJS sends to employee]
   ↓
[Toast changes to: "Email sent! John Smith notified"]
   ↓
[Badge disappears (0 pending requests)]
```

### Badge Behavior:
- Shows on Admin Panel tab
- Number = count of pending requests
- Updates automatically
- Pulses to draw attention
- Disappears when count = 0

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If emails still don't send:
1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Verify EMAIL_CONFIG** in script.js has correct values
3. **Check EmailJS dashboard** for delivery logs
4. **Test EmailJS** directly from their website first
5. **Check spam folders** for test emails

### If badge doesn't appear:
1. **Refresh the page** after submitting a request
2. **Check console** for JavaScript errors
3. **Verify** request status is actually "pending"
4. **Count manually** in the Pending Requests section

### Common Issues:
- **"Email not configured"** → Need to set up EmailJS (see EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- **"403 Forbidden"** → EmailJS credentials incorrect
- **"Template not found"** → Template ID doesn't exist in EmailJS
- **Badge shows wrong number** → Refresh page to reload data
